					<p>Two years ago, I found myself at the top of a four-meter wall holding onto nothing but a small
						rock-shaped piece of plastic. I was a little scared, tired, and unsure if I would be able to
						complete the climb. Not only did I hold on and complete the climb, I began my journey into the
						sport of rock climbing. Two years later, I have gained experience climbing both indoors and
						outdoors, improved my technique and strength, and have become certified in top rope belay and
						lead climbing. I have met some of my best friends climbing and found a home in the community
						that climbing provides. I would recommend anyone who is even the slightest bit interested, to
						start today!</p>

					<p>Indoor rock climbing has grown rapidly in popularity and reached global audiences with its
						inclusion in the Olympics. I love that rock climbing is both a mental and physical challenge;
						brute strength cannot make you the most successful, you also need problem-solving skills and
						technique. There are three main types of climbing: bouldering, top rope, and lead climbing.
						Bouldering is the most popular and the most accessible. Unlike top rope and lead climbing, no
						harness, certification, rope, or belay device is required. (While I do not cover top rope and
						lead climbing in this article, you can learn more <a
							href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/getting-started-rock-climbing.html"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.) However, accessibility is heavily
						dependent on the routes in the gym.
					</p>
					<p>Routes, called "projects", are essentially just paths of plastic rock-like holds. These paths are
						composed of a sequence of rock holds with specific rock hold types, as depicted in Figure 1,
						that are spaced out at varying distances on the wall. Completing a project is accomplished by
						touching the last hold in the route with both hands for three seconds. Routes are also completed
						by "topping out", which is the act of climbing onto the top of the boulder. Routes are various
						difficulty levels, called "grades". Boulders are graded on the V Scale, created by famous
						climber John Sherman, with V0 being the easiest climb and V17 being the current hardest climb
						(Beale, 2021).</p>
					<div class="image-figure">
						<img src="images/climbing_hold_types.jpg">
						<p class="caption">Figure 1. Various climbing holds and how to hold onto them (Understanding
							Climbing Hold Names: A Comprehensive Guide, 2024)</p>
					</div>
					<p>At indoor gyms, employees manually create climbing projects by bolting different climbing holds
						onto the bouldering wall. These climbs are typically of various grades. This process is known as
						route setting. Most gyms are consistent with route setting, but I have been to gyms that reset
						routes infrequently and without much grade diversity. When this happens, I lose motivation to
						climb because either the routes are still the same from a couple months ago, the routes are
						outside of my range, or the climbs are just simply boring. In addition, I have been to gyms
						where in one gym a certain climb is considered V2 but in the other, a similar route is
						considered a V4. As a climber, this is extremely frustrating as I work to improve my climbing by
						climbing higher grades. If I don't know what my actual level of climbing is, it makes it harder
						to improve. Route setting consistency and accuracy is important to commercial gym success.</p>
					<p>The route setters at each gym largely determine the climber's experience through the difficulty,
						creativity, and safety of the route. However, every route setter has different capabilities,
						which makes the route setters subjective and prone to biases when grading climbs – formally
						known as the Grading Bias Problem. This bias often leads to inconsistent grading and climbs that
						require repetitive movement patterns. This issue is where I believe artificial intelligence can
						provide the solution.
					</p>
					<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning can improve the climber experience while
						simultaneously reducing the work put on route setters. It would be a win-win for climbers and
						the gyms they climb at. Climbers would receive more interesting climbs and route setters would
						not have to work as hard to grade the problems, potentially being able to reset climbs more
						often (another win for climbers). Artificial intelligence allows us to analyze the routes the
						route setters have created. Furthermore, it allows us to analyze climber's performance, predict
						movement patterns, and adjust routes accordingly. How can artificial intelligence be used to
						improve route setting by optimizing difficulty level, movement and route diversity, and climber
						experience at indoor gyms?

					<h2>Existing Research</h2>
				</header>
				<div id="articleText">
					<p>A group of researchers at the University of New Hampshire have already started researching the
						potential for artificial intelligence and machine learning to aid in route setting. They first
						attempted to quantify difficulty, which includes qualitative data, like the climber's perceived
						difficulty, and quantitative data, such as the sequence of holds and angle of the wall. Machine
						learning models are usually defined by the objective, but in this case, they are defined by the
						approach. They identified three main approaches to studying the effectiveness of artificial
						intelligence and machine learning: "route-centric, climber-centric, and path finding and path
						generation" (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025). </p>
					<h3>Route-Centric Approach</h3>
					<p>The route-centric approach focuses on the route qualities, like the hold types. A majority of the
						models they used included information from the MoonBoard route database (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025).
						As shown in Figure 2, the MoonBoard is a standardized interactive wooden training wall,
						developed by Ben Moon in 2005 (What Is the MoonBoard?, n.d.). While the MoonBoard has a set
						number of holds, 198 to be exact, situated on an 18 by 11 grid, there are over 300,000
						bouldering routes. Many of these routes are created and uploaded by users of the MoonBoard and
						the MoonBoard team. They decided to use the MoonBoard database because of the predetermined
						holds, unlike commercial gyms which use a variety of holds that change whenever they reset
						routes.</p>
					<div class="image-figure">
						<img src="images/moonboard.jpg">
						<p class="caption">Figure 2. Three MoonBoards lined up side by side with a climber on the middle
							board (What Is the MoonBoard?, n.d.)</p>
					</div>
					<p>O'Mara and Mahumud's paper mentions another group of researchers, Philips, Becker, and Bradley.
						These researchers have "laid the foundation for using NLP (natural language processing)
						algorithms in describing climbing routes as a sequence of holds/movements with their route
						variation generator" (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025). They called their generator Strange Beta. "Beta"
						is a climbing term that is essentially just instructions on how to climb and complete a route.
						They show how these instructions can be parsed by the algorithm to determine a grade for the
						climb. </p>
					<p>Another group of researchers first attempted to classify the difficulty level of climbs in the
						MoonBoard database. To avoid too much technical jargon described in their process, in summary,
						their classifier was accurate 34% of the time (if you want to read more, citations are at the
						end of the article). Two more researchers, Duh and Chang, improved upon previous image data and
						models to create a new grade classifier, called GradeNet (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025). They added a
						pre-processing step, called BetaMove, that determines the sequence of holds the climber should
						follow and then passes the sequence to the classifier. The accuracy of this classifier increased
						to 46.7%. Despite this increase, the algorithm only considered ten grades instead of thirteen.
						However, when the classifier was allowed a standard deviation of one grade, the accuracy
						increased to 84.7%, which is on par with human prediction accuracy (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025). </p>
					<div class="image-figure">
						<img src="images/moonboard_sequence_duh_chang.jpg">
						<p class="caption">Figure 3. Duh and Chang's pre-processing step that sequences holds (O’Mara &
							Mahmud, 2025)</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Climber-Centric Approach</h3>
					<p>The climber-centric approach focuses on the climber's qualities, like the highest grade they have
						climbed. While this approach may seem more subjective, performance and history can be indicative
						of the route difficulty. For this approach, they used wearable sensors to record climber data
						during their ascents. Similar to how wearable technology is already used for running and other
						popular sports, new technologies could be created for climbers. This technology, while most
						likely mainly designed for the climber, could also be used to determine climbing grades. </p>
					<p>To take into account climber ability while grading routes, they make an assumption that the
						climber's performance decreases as the climber attempts routes that are out of their range. A
						researcher observed that a decrease in performance is indicated by "inaccurate gripping,
						increased use of strength during transition periods, trembling during rest periods" (O'Mara &
						Mahmud, 2025). Skill degradation over climbs was impacted by the core climbing abilities: power,
						control, stability, and speed (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025). This biometric data proved to be quite
						useful in accurately classifying routes, which ended up being roughly 98% accurate!
					</p>
					<p>In addition to climber biometrics, they scraped databases from logbook apps to get route ascent
						history. This data can show the grade by providing a connection between the perceived grade of
						the climb, the climber's ability at a certain time, and the probability that the climber
						completes the climb (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025). However, due to the data in log books being
						self-reported, there are many biases that can be introduced. For example, climbers are often
						more likely to log climbs they have completed and less likely to log failed attempts. In
						addition, hardness is perceived differently by each climber and is inherently subjective.
						Creating an app or tool that automatically logs attempts could help reduce this bias.</p>
					<h3>Path Finding and Generation</h3>
					<p>The path finding and generation approach focuses on both aspects of the route-centric approach
						and the climber-centric approach. Essentially, this approach considers route setting (path
						generation) and the climber finding a solution (path finding). "The most optimal solution would
						be the one with the lowest path finding cost" (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025). This means that the best
						solution for the climber is the one that takes the least amount of energy. Algorithms, like A*
						and Dijkstra's, are used to calculate the least-cost path. They attempted to find the optimal
						path using these algorithms while keeping in mind the positional limits of the physical human
						body. As shown in Figure 5, simulated human positions can include physical measurements and
						preferred positions. This idea proved more difficult than expected. As it turns out, it is not
						clear how to figure out the most ideal solution even when given these parameters. Despite these
						setbacks, path finding approaches that simulate climber movement demonstrate potential for
						improving grade determination.</p>
					<div class="image-figure">
						<img src="images/simulated_climber_position.jpg">
						<p class="caption">Figure 5. Simulated climber with measurements and preferred position (O’Mara
							&
							Mahmud, 2025)</p>
					</div>
					<p>Not all route generation methods rely on path finding algorithms, many use NLP-based techniques
						like the previously mentioned Strange Beta. They also found that using natural language
						processing to create routes has proved the most useful among other climbers who tested different
						creation methods. When creating routes with Strange Beta, they found that while some of the
						climbs generated were odd and unclimbable, most climbers preferred the routes made with Strange
						Beta (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025). Duh and Chang also found success with their model and 80% of
						climbers thought the climbs were high quality and 95% of climbers thought the grade was
						reasonable given the difficulty (O'Mara & Mahmud, 2025).</p>

					<h2>AI in Sports</h2>

				<div id="articleText">
					<p>A tech startup in Norway, called Belay AI, has already started to integrate artificial intelligence into training. They achieve this through the use of computer vision and artificial intelligence algorithms. No sensors are used to record data, making the team's approach unique. Climbers can receive real-time analysis, tailored and instant feedback to improve performance and other features that can help optimize technique (Belay AI - AI That Understands Climbing, n.d.).</p>
					<p>Through the use of computer vision, the team is able to track the climber's body position on the wall, estimate the speed of different body parts, and track the climber's center of gravity (Belay AI - AI That Understands Climbing, n.d.). All of these features help the algorithms analyze how climbers adjust their technique during a climb, as well as determine where dynamic movements are required, and when the climber is balanced and in control. The startup has already received user testimonials from professional climbers and route-setters.</p>
					<p>While there is limited research on applications of artificial intelligence in climbing, more research exists in a general sports environment, specifically related to training. Artificial intelligence allows humans to analyze data more efficiently and with technologies constantly advancing, data processing and analysis can become even better. "At present, AI integration in sports extends far beyond basic performance analytics, encompassing strategic planning, real-time decision-making, and exercise prescription" (Mateus et al., 2024). The use of artificial intelligence combined with the data captured from wearable technology provides sports analysts the capability to precisely provide training suggestions. Currently, artificial intelligence has been utilized for basketball, football, golf, badminton, and taekwondo (Wei et al., 2021). As shown in Figure 6, artificial intelligence and wearable technology can track the swing trajectory of the club based on the golf player’s movements.</p>

					<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
				</header>
				<div id="articleText">
					<p>Incorporating artificial intelligence into route setting can change the game for climbers and gyms across the world. While I don't think we should completely replace route setters with an algorithm, supplementing manual route setting with an artificial intelligence aid can lift the weight off of route setters. Introducing artificial intelligence and machine learning is not just about convenience, I also think adding more objectivity into route setting can help push the climbing gym community towards a standardization of difficulty level. This standardization can help make climbing more inclusive and reduce gatekeeping by making it more accessible to climbers of all skill levels. Now that the Olympics include sport climbing, having a standardized grading system makes more sense to me. If the other sports in the Olympics have predetermined rules and regulations, why shouldn't rock climbing grades?</p>
					<p>The introduction of artificial intelligence also allows the sport to become more personalized. Implementing technologies like computer vision into training can help climbers of different skill sets and abilities progress and develop new techniques. I also believe that at some point artificial intelligence and machine learning tools can be used to generate routes on any gym's bouldering wall, not just standardized boards like the MoonBoard. I am excited to see where this technology will take us and what the future of climbing will look like. One day, I may find myself again at the top of a four-meter wall holding onto a hold that was suggested by artificial intelligence.</p>
