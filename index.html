									<h2>Introduction</h2>

								<div id="articleText">
									<p>Two years ago, I found myself at the top of a four meter wall holding onto nothing but a small rock shaped piece of plastic. Not only did I hold on and complete the climb, I began my journey into the sport of rock climbing. Two years later, I have climbed both indoors and outdoors, improved my technique and strength, and have become certified in top rope belay and lead climbing.</p>

									<p>Indoor rock climbing has grown rapidly in popularity and reached global audiences with its inclusion in the Olympics. I love that rock climbing is both a mental and physical challenge; brute strength cannot make you the most successful, you also need problem-solving skills and technique. There are three main types of climbing: bouldering, top rope, and lead climbing. Bouldering is the most popular and the most accessible. Unlike top rope and lead climbing, no harness, certification, rope, or belay device is required. (While I do not cover top rope and lead climbing in this article, you can learn more <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/getting-started-rock-climbing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.) However, accessibility is dependent on the routes in the gym.</p>
									<p>Routes, also called “projects”, are essentially just paths of plastic rock-like holds. These paths are made up of a sequence of rock holds with specific rock hold types (see Figure 1) that are spaced out in varying distances on the wall. Completing a project is accomplished by touching the last hold in the route with both hands for three seconds. Routes are various difficulty levels, called “grades”. Boulders are graded on the V Scale, created by famous climber John Sherman, with V0 being the easiest climb and V17 being the current highest graded climb (Beale, 2021). At indoor gyms, employees manually create climbing projects of various grades. This process is known as route setting. I have been to gyms that reset routes infrequently and without much grade diversity. When this happens, I lose motivation to climb because either the routes are the same from a couple months ago or the routes are outside of my range. In addition, I have been to gyms where in one a certain climb is considered V2 but in the other, a similar route is considered a V4. Route setting consistency and accuracy is important to commercial gym success.</p>
									<p>The route setters at each gym largely determine the climber’s experience through the difficulty, creativity, and safety of the route. However, every route setter has different capabilities, which makes the route setters subjective and prone to biases when grading climbs. This is formally known as the Grading Bias Problem. This often leads to inconsistent grading and repetitive movement patterns. This is where artificial intelligence can provide the solution.</p>
									<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning can improve the climber experience while simultaneously reducing the work put on route setters. This would be a win win for climbers and the gyms they climb at. Artificial intelligence allows us to analyze climber’s performance, predict movement patterns, and adjust routes accordingly. It also allows us to analyze the routes the route setters have created. How can artificial intelligence be used to improve rock climbing route setting by optimizing difficulty level, movement and route diversity, and climber experience at indoor gyms?</p>
