					<p>Two years ago, I found myself at the top of a four meter wall holding onto nothing but a small
						rock shaped piece of plastic. Not only did I hold on and complete the climb, I began my journey
						into the sport of rock climbing. Two years later, I have climbed both indoors and outdoors,
						improved my technique and strength, and have become certified in top rope belay and lead
						climbing.</p>

					<p>Indoor rock climbing has grown rapidly in popularity and reached global audiences with its
						inclusion
						in the Olympics. I love that rock climbing is both a mental and physical challenge; brute
						strength
						cannot make you the most successful, you also need problem-solving skills and technique. There
						are
						three main types of climbing: bouldering, top rope, and lead climbing. Bouldering is the most
						popular and the most accessible. Unlike top rope and lead climbing, no harness, certification,
						rope,
						or belay device is required. (While I do not cover top rope and lead climbing in this article,
						you
						can learn more <a
							href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/getting-started-rock-climbing.html"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.) However, accessibility is dependent on
						the
						routes in the gym.</p>
					<p>Routes, also called “projects”, are essentially just paths of plastic rock-like holds. These
						paths
						are made up of a sequence of rock holds with specific rock hold types (see Figure 1) that are
						spaced
						out in varying distances on the wall. Completing a project is accomplished by touching the last
						hold
						in the route with both hands for three seconds. Routes are various difficulty levels, called
						“grades”. Boulders are graded on the V Scale, created by famous climber John Sherman, with V0
						being
						the easiest climb and V17 being the current highest graded climb (Beale, 2021). At indoor gyms,
						employees manually create climbing projects of various grades. This process is known as route
						setting. I have been to gyms that reset routes infrequently and without much grade diversity.
						When
						this happens, I lose motivation to climb because either the routes are the same from a couple
						months
						ago or the routes are outside of my range. In addition, I have been to gyms where in one a
						certain
						climb is considered V2 but in the other, a similar route is considered a V4. Route setting
						consistency and accuracy is important to commercial gym success.</p>

					</div>

					<p>The route setters at each gym largely determine the climber’s experience through the difficulty,
						creativity, and safety of the route. However, every route setter has different capabilities,
						which
						makes the route setters subjective and prone to biases when grading climbs. This is formally
						known
						as the Grading Bias Problem. This often leads to inconsistent grading and repetitive movement
						patterns. This is where artificial intelligence can provide the solution.</p>
					<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning can improve the climber experience while
						simultaneously
						reducing the work put on route setters. This would be a win win for climbers and the gyms they
						climb
						at. Artificial intelligence allows us to analyze climber’s performance, predict movement
						patterns,
						and adjust routes accordingly. It also allows us to analyze the routes the route setters have
						created. How can artificial intelligence be used to improve rock climbing route setting by
						optimizing difficulty level, movement and route diversity, and climber experience at indoor
						gyms?

					<h2>Existing Research</h2>
				</header>
				<div id="articleText">
					<p>A group of researchers at the University of New Hampshire have already started researching the
						potential for artificial intelligence and machine learning to aid in route setting. They first
						attempted to quantify difficulty, which includes qualitative data, like the climber's perceived
						difficulty, and quantitative data, such as the sequence of holds and angle of the wall. Machine
						learning models are usually defined by the objective, but in this case they are defined by the
						approach. They identified three main approaches to studying the effectiveness of artificial
						intelligence and machine learning: “route-centric, climber-centric, and path finding and path
						generation” (O’Mara & Mahmud, 2025).</p>
					<p>The route-centric approach focuses on the route qualities, like the hold types. A majority of the
						models they used included information from the MoonBoard route database (O’Mara & Mahmud, 2025).
						The MoonBoard is a standardized interactive wooden training wall, developed by Ben Moon in 2005
						(What Is the MoonBoard?, n.d.). While the MoonBoard has a set number of holds, 198 to be exact,
						situated on an 18 by 11 grid, there are over 300,000 bouldering routes (see Figure 2). Many of
						these routes are created and uploaded by users of the MoonBoard and the MoonBoard team. They
						decided to use the MoonBoard database because of the predetermined holds, unlike commercial gyms
						which use a variety of holds that change whenever they reset routes.</p>
